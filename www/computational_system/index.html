            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>
               In book eight of Athanasius Kircher’s <cite>Musurgia universalis</cite> (Rome, 1650), this Jesuit polymath describes a computing device for automated music
               composition, called the <em>Arca musarithmica</em>.
               A new software implementation of Kircher’s device in Haskell, a pure-functional programming
               language, demonstrates that the Arca can be made into a completely automatic computational
               system.
               Moreover, the project also demonstrates that in its original form, the Arca already
               constituted a computational system optimized for a human user, and almost completely
               automatic: as Kircher advertised, a completely <q>amusical</q> user could generate music simply by using the device according to his rules.
               The device itself served as a microcosm of Kircher’s goal in the <cite>Musurgia</cite> to encapsulate and codify all musical knowledge, and demonstrate that music manifested
               the underlying mathematical order of the Creation and its Creator.
               This article analyzes the concepts and methods of computation in Kircher’s original
               system, in dialogue with the interpretation of his system in software.
               The Arca musarithmica, now available on the web, makes it possible actually to hear
               how well Kircher was able to reduce seventeenth-century music to algorithmic rules.
               The successes of the system are inseparable from many paradoxical elements that raises
               broader questions about how Kircher and his contemporaries understood the links between
               composition and computation, mathematics and rhetoric, traditional harmonic theory
               and emerging tonal practice, and concepts of <q>invention</q> and authorship.

            <h1>1. An <q>Ark</q> of Musical Invention in Infinite Permutations</h1>
            <p>
               In 1650 Athanasius Kircher published a detailed specification for a device called
               the <q>Arca musarithmica</q>, which appears to be an analog computing device for automatic music composition
               (<a class="bibref" href="#Kircher:Musurgia">Kircher 1650</a>, II: 1–199).
               Within the ten books of the <cite>Musurgia universalis</cite>, this German-born Jesuit scholar of ancient languages and mathematics (1602–1680)
               attempted to compile everything that was known about music in a single Latin treatise
               (<a class="bibref" href="#Findlen:Kircher">Findlen 2004a</a>; 
               <a class="bibref" href="#Fletcher:Kircher">Fletcher 2011</a>;
               <a class="bibref" href="#Godwin:KircherTheater">Godwin 2009</a>).
               The device he describes in book eight is more than a demonstration of musical combinatorics:
               Kircher epitomizes his whole concept of music in one small box
               (<a class="bibref" href="#Bohnert:Kircher">Bohnert 2010</a>;

               <a class="bibref" href="#Wald:KircherMusurgia">Wald 2006</a>, 134–143).
               </p>
            <p>
               In the eighth book Kircher announces an <q>ars nova musarithmica recenter inventa</q>, <q>a new musical-numerical method, recently discovered, by means of which even an untrained
                  musician can achieve perfect composition in a short time</q> 
               (<a class="bibref" href="#Kircher:Musurgia">Kircher 1650</a>, II: 1).
               Kircher’s <q>new method</q> is a system for automatic music composition, embodied in the physical device whose
               name means something like <q>box of musical calculation</q> 
               (<a class="figref" href="#fig-ark-image">figure 1</a>).
               By means of this device, he says, a <q>Tyro</q> (novice) or even an <q>amusical person</q> can compose nearly every type of modern music from simple four-part homophony to
               florid, imitative counterpoint, and even polychoral and recitative styles.
               Moreover, an <em>amusicus</em> (someone without musical knowledge) can compose music expressive of any mood, and
               can even set words to music from any world language—all simply by operating the device
               according to Kircher’s detailed rules.
               Kircher advertises that, if used properly, the ark can produce music that a professional
               musician would recognize as correct, appropriate to the text, and
               rich in variety. 
               He includes a full sample composition which he says was generated by an untrained
               musician using the ark and heard with acclaim in elite Roman circles
               (<a class="bibref" href="#Kircher:Musurgia">Kircher 1650</a>, II: 166).

            <p>
               While skepticism might be warranted for some of Kircher’s claims, there is evidence
               that people around the globe did build and operate the Arca musarithmica.
               By means of the lavishly printed 1650 treatise, Kircher’s ark voyaged through Jesuit
               networks as far as Mexico City and Manila
               (<a class="bibref" href="#Findlen:KircherAmerica">Findlen 2004b</a>;
               <a class="bibref" href="#Irving:Colonial">Irving 2010</a>, 48–50).
               Three surviving physical implementations of the Arca musarithmica from Kircher’s time
               have been found, in Cambridge, Wolfenbüttel, and Florence; and some evidence suggests
               that a version of the device was known in the German lands
               (<a class="bibref" href="#Annibaldi:FrobergerRome">Annibaldi 1995</a>;
               <a class="bibref" href="#Bohnert:Kircher">Bohnert 2010</a>, 127–156;
               <a class="bibref" href="#Boni:ArcaFlorence">Boni 2020</a>).
               I discovered an additional copy of the Arca in Puebla (Mexico), which was made around
               1690, probably by a university mathematics professor who was part of a circle of Kircher
               aficionados in New Spain that included the poet Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz
               (<a class="bibref" href="#Cashner:KircherSpanish">Cashner 2022b</a>;
               <a class="bibref" href="#Osorio:LuzImaginaria">Osorio Romero 1993</a>;
               <a class="bibref" href="#Trabulse:Circulo">Trabulse 1984</a>;
               <a class="bibref" href="#Beuchot:SorJuanaKircher">Beuchot Puente 1995</a>;
               <a class="bibref" href="#Maxey:SorJuanaKircherIconography">Maxey 2020</a>).
               (Sor Juana coined the term <em>kircherizar</em>, <q>to Kircherize</q>, to describe the intellectual and theological process that Kircher inspired her to
               follow.)
               I also found a pamphlet describing the Arca from late eighteenth-century Madrid.
               While a physical implementation of the Arca might have value purely as a curiosity,
               it is hard to believe that no one ever tried to use them as intended.
               In fact, the version in Puebla includes only a partial selection of Kircher’s data
               tables, which seem to have been selected for their practical value.
               </p>
            <p>
               None of the surviving implementations are automatic machines, though: the Wolfenbüttel
               and Cambridge versions are wooden boxes with paper slats inside holding Kircher’s
               tables of numbers and notes, and the Puebla version is just paper copies of the tables.
               Indeed, Carlo Mario Chierotti argues that despite Kircher’s use of terms like <em>mechanicus</em> and <em>artificiosus</em> to describe the Arca, his invention is neither mechanical nor automatic; and in fact
               requires significant discretion from a human operator to produce workable results
               (<a class="bibref" href="#Chierotti:KircherComporre">Chierotti 1994</a>, 390).
               Jim Bumgardner calls a related device by Kircher <q>nothing more than a glorified recipe box</q>
               (<a class="bibref" href="#Bumgardner:Kircher">Bumgardner 2009</a>, 3). 
               </p>
            <p>
               Did the Arca musarithmica really work as advertised?
               And should we consider it to be a form of computer?
               What kind of computation did Kircher think was necessary to compose music, and how
               did he connect concepts of calculation and composition?
               How did Kircher encode musical knowledge in the Arca, did his invention actually output
               music that would be judged coherent and intelligible?
               </p>
            <p>
               To answer these questions, I created a working, completely automatic, <a href="https://github.com/andrewacashner/kircher">software implementation</a> of Kircher’s Arca musarithmica in the pure-functional programming language Haskell.
               Anyone may generate music using the <a href="https://www.arca1650.info">web application version</a>, which also includes the complete source code and documentation written in a literate
               programming style.
               Users can choose among prepared input texts and select the style, meter, and mood
               of the music; or they can even type in their own text.
               Building the ark in software is more than just a programming project; it is an act
               of interpretation balancing textual analysis with creative synthesis.
               The implementation serves two main purposes: first, it tests the hypothesis that Kircher
               actually did describe an effective system for musical composition in the form of an
               algorithm that only lacked the technological means to make it fully automated.
               Second, it makes it possible to test the output of the ark to a degree Kircher could
               not have imagined, and thereby to evaluate the kind of musical knowledge encoded in
               the ark and how much musical knowledge is actually required to generate acceptable
               music with the system.
               </p>
            <p>
               I argue that Kircher did establish a computational system for composition, including
               data structures and algorithms, in which he formulated specifically musical conceptions
               of computation.
               The program demonstrates that it is possible to conceive of the entire ark as a single
               mathematical function: it takes one series of symbols, representing an input text
               and the choice of musical parameters, and transforms those into another set of symbols
               that represents musical notation. 
               Kircher explicitly aims to provide a mathematically sound method of composition, and
               though his specifications fall short of the standards of modern computer science,
               his algorithm works.
               The musical results generated by this implementation do sound like mid-seventeenth-century
               Italianate music in a conservative, church-oriented style.
               There are some mistakes in the data and portions of the instructions are underspecified
               or omitted, but in the end only a few parts of the system actually required the addition
               of missing data or processes.
               In most of those cases Kircher was probably right to assume that a human user would
               supply these gaps intuitively.
               These places where Kircher skips a step or assumes knowledge that is not encoded in
               the ark actually reveal important aspects of his understanding of music, because the
               whole device should be understood as an attempt to systematize a compositional theory
               of music.
               </p>
            <p>
               This is not the first attempt to implement the ark: in addition to the physical implementations
               already mentioned, Agnes Cäcilie Bohnert modeled the ark in a Java program, and Bumgardner
               built a related, simpler system in Perl.  
               Bumgardner’s program implemented the musical portion of the <em>Organum mathematicum</em> described by Kircher’s student Gaspar Schott, which was much simpler musically but
               could also compute the date of Easter and solve other problems.
               Bohnert’s dissertation provides a comprehensive treatment of book eight of the <cite>Musurgia</cite>, tracing its mathematical and philosophical foundations (such as the <cite>Ars combinatoria</cite> of Raimond Llull) and comparing the description of the Arca to the two physical implementations.
               According to Bohnert’s description of the software (which I was unable to access),
               the program implemented the two complete syntagmata (I and II) in way that followed
               closely the manual method described by Kircher
               (<a class="bibref" href="#Bohnert:Kircher">Bohnert 2010</a>, 123–126).
               Users would select musical permutations one at a time, adjust them, and add them to
               the musical composition, and then hear the result. 
               The program is not described as fully automatic, however, and Bohnert says it can
               only create very short settings of a small number of texts.
               The implementation presented here is to my knowledge the first realization of the
               Arca musarithmica to be fully automatic and to be capable of setting texts of any
               length and type.
               Examples <a class="figref" href="#ex-Ave_maris_stella-simple"> 1</a> and <a class="figref" href="#ex-Ave_maris_stella-florid"> 2</a> show simple and florid settings of the hymn <cite>Ave maris stella</cite> automatically generated by the ark.
               </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
               I focus my examination of the ark on the ways that it embodies musical concepts of
               computation.
               I consider the components of Kircher’s original device as a human-operated system,
               and discuss what was necessary to translate it for use by a digital automaton.
               I close with reflections on how Kircher’s system reflects widespread views of the
               nature of music and of compositional craft, and how at the same time it demonstrates
               a gap between theory and practice.

               <p>
                  The original Arca should not be dismissed as a computing device because it requires
                  a human operator, or because its design may seem simple. 
                  A computational system does not require an electronic implementation; in fact, the
                  fundamental modern concepts of computing, Turing machines and Church’s lambda calculus,
                  were defined before there existed any means of automating them.
                  If the human operator’s role is purely mechanical and does not require intelligent
                  decisions, then the system should still be considered automatic.
                  With some exceptions to be discussed below, the user of the original Arca, like the
                  human operator of a Turing machine, simply follows prescribed rules to transform symbols
                  on paper.
                  Kircher’s system is optimized for a human user, not because it depends on human discretion,
                  but because it enables a human to access the data easily and manipulate it by rule.
                  What may seem a simple structure of lookup tables is, first, more complex than
                  it appears, and second, still a valid computational system. 
                  This section will focus on the original specification for the ark as a human-operated
                  system, and will show how each component embodies musical
                  concept of computation.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  As Kircher’s illustration (<a class="figref" href="#fig-ark-image">figure 1</a>) shows, the ark contains different kinds of musical information on the outside, on
                  the lid, and stored within. 
                  The user is supposed to choose a text to set to music, in Latin by default, and prepare
                  the text by dividing it into sections, phrases, words, and syllables.
                  For each segment, the user must select an appropriate style and mood for the setting.
                  Next the operator goes through the text phrase by phrase, and for each selects a <em>pinax</em> (rod or slat) from the appropriate <em>syntagma</em> (division), based on the intended musical style and the poetic meter of the text.
                  The ark includes three <em>syntagmata</em>: the first is for simple, syllabic, homorhythmic counterpoint; while the second is
                  for florid, melismatic counterpoint with imitation and even fugato.
                  The third syntagma theoretically includes a huge range of styles and techniques but
                  Kircher only published a small portion of it, claiming that he reserved the rest in
                  secret for the eyes of <q>princes and worthy friends</q> only 
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Kircher:Musurgia">Kircher 1650</a>, II: 184).
                  </p>
               <p>
                  From the tables of numbers and rhythmic durations marked on the <em>pinakes</em> (plural of the borrowed Greek <em>pinax</em>) the user extracts pre-arranged permutations of numbers and rhythmic values.
                  The user chooses a mood to suit the text from the table of tones (<em>toni ecclesiastici</em> or <q>church keys</q>) on the lid, and then matches numbers to the pitch names and potential accidentals
                  shown there.
                  Finally, the table on the front specifies how to inscribe these notes on paper within
                  acceptable ranges for the four voices.
                  The ark’s output is a notated musical composition for four voices (<em>cantus</em> or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass).
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Kircher’s Arca includes most of the elements that make up any modern computational
                  system.
                  The marked-up lyrical text forms the input; the slats with musical permutations and
                  the lookup tables of pitches and accidentals are function as part of a stored program;
                  and the music paper serves as both a temporary processing area (like working memory)
                  and output medium.
                  The data on the ark’s pinax tables is encoded in a form that allows for compact storage
                  and quick retrieval.
                  The ark’s tables should be understood as data structures whose design implies the
                  algorithms needed to access and manipulate them
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Wirth:Algorithms">Wirth 1976</a>, xii–xiii). 
                  Likewise the tables map inputs to outputs according to a rule and are therefore closely
                  related to functions.
                  The human operator must do the actual processing of course, but the user must do this
                  according to Kircher’s prescriptions, equivalent to the program.
                  And except in a few areas, Kircher does provide a complete list of procedures, specifying
                  an algorithm that may not be quite precise enough to meet a rigorous mathematical
                  definition but is nevertheless functional
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Knuth:TAOCP1">Knuth 1997</a>, 1–7).
                  Since the software implementation of Kircher’s algorithm does satisfy modern theoretical
                  requirements, I will note where I found it necessary to complete the specification.

                  <p>
                     Examining Kircher’s data structures more closely will show the ways in which he has
                     encoded musical data in order to make it possible for a human operator to manipulate
                     musical materials in a mechanical way.
                     Inside the actual arca or box there are three groups (the syntagmata) of long, solid
                     slats (the pinakes).
                     The choice of syntagma is determined by the style of text-setting: respectively, simple
                     homophony, florid counterpoint, or mixed.
                     (This software fully implements only the completely specified syntagma I and II, and
                     it is not clear if syntagma III could be fully automated based only on Kircher’s specification.)
                     Within each syntagma the choice of pinax is a function of the poetic meter of the
                     input text.
                     </p>
                  <p>
                     The design of the pinakes recall Napier’s bones and similar calculating devices.
                     The user removes the needed pinakes from the box and arranges them on a work surface
                     to extract data from them.
                     <a class="figref" href="#fig-s1p4">Figure 2</a> shows the slat used to set the hymn <cite>Ave maris stella</cite> in simple style, syntagma I, pinax 4; while <a class="figref" href="#fig-s2p2a">figure 3</a> shows the one used to set the same hymn in florid style: syntagama II, pinax II.
                     
                     Each pinax has two components: lists of integers one through eight and lists of note
                     symbols.
                     Kircher uses the term <em>musarithmos</em> (musical numbers) primarily to refer to the tables of numbers; for greater precision
                     I call the pitch numbers <em>vperms</em> (voice permutations) and the durations <em>rperms</em> (rhythm permutations).

               <h1>2.2. Encoding Pitches and Rhythms</h1>
               <p>
                  The vperms and rperms are arranged differently in each syntagma.
                  In Syntagma I, all the voices use the same rhythm, so Kircher writes separate tables
                  of vperms and rperms: the user pairs a four-voice vperm from the top of the pinax
                  with an rperm on the bottom that is a single list of durations.
                  Since the music in this syntagma is syllabic, the columns correspond to successive
                  syllables in the input text.
                  In Syntagma II, by contrast, Kircher enables complex counterpoint by pairing four-voice
                  vperms with four-voice rperms, so that each voice has its own rhythm.
                  Here the music is melismatic, and there can be a different number of notes in each
                  voice.
                  Since Kircher never provides precise rules for how to underlay the lyrical text in
                  syntagma II, it would be more accurate to think of these vperm rows as lists of notes
                  rather than as table columns, which is how they are implemented in the software.
                  In most pinakes of both syntagmata, the user is supposed to choose from a different
                  column based on the order of poetic lines in the input text.  Kircher calls these
                  <em>strophae</em>, which despite the cognate means lines not stanzas.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Kircher does not encode pitch directly in the vperm tables; instead, the integers
                  are actually lookup keys for the <em>mensa tonographica</em> or tone table, where letters A through G plus sharp or flat symbols represent the
                  pitch classes.
                  In modern terms the numerals represent scale degrees relative to the modal final of
                  a particular tone, so that in tone I, with its final on D, <span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">5</span></span> is A.
                  Kircher uses both 1 and 8 to refer to the final, often to express stepwise motion
                  between <span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">7</span></span> and <span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">8</span></span>.
                  Each pinax includes specifications of which tones are acceptable, sometimes in a box
                  to the side, other times at the top of each column, and some in the introductory text.
                  At this stage the numbers only correspond to note names and also to potential accidentals;
                  the octave and duration are still unspecified.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  To encode rhythms, Kircher uses note symbols for the different rhythmic values: 
                  breve (<span class="music">𝅜</span>),
                  semibreve (<span class="music">𝅝</span>),
                  minim (<span class="music">𝅗𝅥</span>),
                  semiminim (<span class="music">𝅘𝅥</span>), and 
                  fusa (<span class="music">𝅘𝅥𝅮</span>),
                  along with the corresponding rest symbols.
                  The rperms in syntagma I are divided into three sections by meter: for duple meter,
                  <q>triple major</q>, and <q>triple minor</q>.
                  In his notated realizations Kircher uses the mensuration sign <span class="music-timesig">𝄵</span> for duple meter, which would normally indicate a metrical pattern in groups of two
                  breves, each divided into two semibreves—i.e., imperfect <em>tempus</em>, <em>alla breve</em>. 
                  In practice, though, about half of his rhythm permutations suggest <span class="music-timesig">𝄴</span>, with groups of two semibreves.
                  The system does not distinguish between these forms of duple meter, probably out of
                  Kircher’s stated desire to maximize the variety of the ark’s output.
                  This would not be a problem for someone choosing the permutations intelligently, but
                  since Kircher does not provide a way to distinguish automatically, this implementation
                  of the ark can produce absurd results in duple meter when the implied subdivision
                  shifts abruptly.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  In Syntagma I, based on the prior choice of musical meter, the user is supposed to
                  choose one of the three meter categories, and then select one of the rperms from the
                  same column as the chosen vperm.
                  In many pinakes of syntagma I, though, there is actually only set of rperms, which
                  is repeated at the bottom of each column.
                  The triple-meter rperms are divided into two sections, one for a ternary proportion
                  of <span class="music-timesig">𝄵</span> and the other for a proportion of <span class="music-timesig">𝄴</span>.
                  Kircher writes these interchangeably as <span class="music-timesig">𝄵</span><span class="music-timesig-num"><span class="timesig"><span class="top">3</span><span class="bottom">2</span></span></span> and <span class="music-timesig">𝄵</span><span class="music-timesig-num">3</span> for <q>Tripla maior</q>, and as <span class="music-timesig">𝄴</span><span class="music-timesig-num"><span class="timesig"><span class="top">3</span><span class="bottom">2</span></span></span> and <span class="music-timesig">𝄴</span><span class="music-timesig-num">3</span> for <q>Tripla minor</q>.
                  The <em>tactus</em> or metrical unit in <span class="music-timesig">𝄵</span><span class="music-timesig-num">3</span> falls on groups of three imperfect semibreves, in a 3:2 proportion to the groups
                  of two semibreves in <span class="music-timesig">𝄵</span>.
                  In <span class="music-timesig">𝄴</span><span class="music-timesig-num">3</span> there are groups of three minims, in the same proportion to the binary groups of
                  minims in <span class="music-timesig">𝄴</span>.
                  In syntagma II all the permutations are in duple meter and the vperms and rperms are
                  paired.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  With this separate encoding of pitch and rhythm, Kircher has discovered a compact
                  way of representing fairly complex polyphonic music.
                  As Chierotti notes, musicians already used numbers to represent pitches in figured-bass
                  notation, where the numbers stood for intervals above the bass note
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Chierotti:KircherComporre">Chierotti 1994</a>).
                  Kircher’s rhythm notation also drew on existing practices like the German keyboard
                  tablature of contemporary organists like Matthias Weckmann, who wrote down letter
                  names in one row with matching duration symbols above 
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Weckmann:ChoraleWorks">Weckmann 1980</a>).
                  The Arca user does not need to decode either numbers or duration symbols mentally,
                  because the numbers are lookup keys for the tone table, and the durations need only
                  to be copied directly onto the music paper.
                  For the rhythm, Kircher might also have used integers keyed to a lookup table (as
                  in the software implementation), but his use of duration symbols is more logical and
                  efficient for a human operator.
                  </p>
            </section>
            <section id="sec-optimized">
               <h1>2.3. Optimized for Automatic Human Operation</h1>
               <p>
                  For a programmer, Kircher’s use of graphical symbols for rhythm seems a hindrance
                  because a digital computer cannnot understand them until they are converted into numbers.
                  
                  For this reason the software implementation uses enumeration labels for durations:
                  it is more convenient for the human programmer to write <code>Sb</code> for a semibreve while the compiler converts this to an integer internally.
                  But Kircher designed his system for an amusical human operator, for whom no thought
                  at all would be required to simply copy the symbols from the rperm table onto the
                  music paper.
                  In that way Kircher’s original graphical encoding is actually more automatic and requires
                  less computation than the software implementation.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Kircher’s use of mensural notation further illustrates his human-oriented design.
                  For a computer, symbols must be unambiguous, so the contextual system of mensural
                  notation in ternary meter poses an obstacle.
                  In <span class="music-timesig">𝄴</span><span class="music-timesig-num">3</span> (rendered in modern notation as <span class="music-timesig-num"><span class="timesig"><span class="top">3</span><span class="bottom">2</span></span></span>), 
                  for example, the mensural figure <span class="music">𝅝</span><span class="music">𝅝</span> is equivalent to the modern <span class="music">𝅝𝅭 </span><span class="music">𝅝𝅭 </span>, 
                  while the mensural figure <span class="music">𝅝</span><span class="music">𝅝</span><span class="music">𝅗𝅥</span> is equivalent to the modern <span class="music">𝅝𝅭 </span><span class="music">𝅝</span><span class="music">𝅗𝅥</span>.
                  In the software implementation it was simpler just to convert the ternary rperms to
                  their modern equivalent, which in most cases simply required adding a dot to the final
                  duration.
                  But in the original system, no conversion or calculation was required at all: an <q>amusical</q> user could simply copy the durations and let the performers figure out the contextual
                  notation.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  For a human user of the physical Arca, once the input parameters are known, all of
                  these data for composing the music can be accessed quite readily by a simple scan
                  of the box and its contents.
                  The human user must know the poetic meter of the text and parse the text into phrases
                  and syllables, and then must choose the intended style, mood, and musical meter.
                  The style tells the user which area of the box to search (which syntagma), and the
                  user then matches the text meter to the label at the top of the appropriate pinax.
                  The user removes the needed pinakes, lays them out in order, and moves them up and
                  down to choose the needed vperm and rperm columns; there is left only to read across
                  the tables and copy down the symbols.
                  In most cases the in-order position of the poetic line determines the choice of column
                  within a pinax.
                  Then for vperms, the selection of a row is a free choice.
                  For rperms in syntagma I, the choice of musical meter determines which subtable of
                  rperms to select and the particular rperm selection is a free choice.
                  In syntagma II, all the rperms are in duple meter and they are already matched to
                  the vperms, so only one choice is needed.
                  Kircher’s design of the pinax limits its useability, because the user must select
                  different rows from a single pinax; they would be easier to use if they were built
                  like slide rules with moveable columns.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Once the numbers are copied or noted mentally, the user can turn to the tone table,
                  where the choice of mood determines the tone, and the tone combined with the vperm
                  integer are the keys for looking up pitch names in the table.
                  The tone table is least optimized part of the system for any operator (aside from
                  the musical problems with Kircher’s whole concept of <em>toni</em>, to be discussed below).
                  Although the user must look information up in the table based on the two inputs of
                  tone number and pitch number, the table is keyed by tone number and pitch name. 
                  Instead of a simple array lookup, then, one has to scan each column to find the pitch
                  number and then look over to the axis to obtain the pitch letter.
                  Because the table also includes potential <em>ficta</em> accidentals, it would make more sense, even with a human user in mind, to put the
                  pitch numbers on the axis and store the pitch letters with their accidentals in the
                  table cells.
                  In terms of computational complexity, Kircher’s table requires O(n) time, versus O(1)
                  for a table indexed by tone and pitch numbers
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Knuth:TAOCP1">Knuth 1997</a>, 107–111).
                  </p>
               <p>
                  To make matters worse, Kircher actually provides two conflicting tone tables, and
                  in contrast to the one shown in the engraving (<a class="figref" href="#fig-ark-image">figure 1</a>), the one given in the text is actually unusable for computation
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Kircher:Musurgia">Kircher 1650</a>, II: facing 185, II: 51).
                  The other table groups the tones out of numerical order to demonstrate patterns; it
                  includes two conflicting entries for tone 8; and among other differences, this table
                  lists a tone 4 with an E final and <span class="music">♯</span><span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">3</span></span> and <span class="music">♭</span><span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">5</span></span>, while in the engraved table,  tone 4 has an A final with <span class="music">♯</span><span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">3</span></span>
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Bohnert:Kircher">Bohnert 2010</a>, 65–77).
                  The software implementation is based on the engraved table.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Kircher never actually specifies a rule for choosing a particular vperm or rperm within
                  a column. 
                  In some places he implies that a random choice would increase variety, while elsewhere
                  he suggests that the user discriminate based on musical considerations.
                  Kircher seems ambivalent about creating a fully automated system, perhaps motivated
                  by theological anxieties about superseding human free will and intelligence, or about
                  chance operations.
                  At the same time, there are numerous ways a human user can simply <q>pick any row</q> and achieve semi-random results.
                  The digital automaton can only simulate a free choice by using a pseudo-random number
                  generator, though in this implementation it would still be possible for a superstitious
                  user to supply their own list of permutation choices.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Regardless of the inconsistencies, Kircher’s encoding system should be recognized
                  as a symbolic representation of music intended to allow a mathematical approach.
                  Kircher compares his system to the working-out of an algebra problem, in which simply
                  by applying a series of rule-based transformations to a set of symbols, one can achieve
                  previously unexpected results
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Kircher:Musurgia">Kircher 1650</a>, II: 2).
                  Kircher’s effort moved in the same direction as contemporary mathematicians Fermat,
                  who shared Kircher’s interest in combinatorics, and Leibniz, with whom Kircher corresponded:
                  his encoding system lifted music into a more abstract realm in which the sonic materials
                  could be manipulated symbolically
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Chierotti:KircherComporre">Chierotti 1994</a>, 389;
                  <a class="bibref" href="#Ifrah:Computing">Ifrah 2001</a>, 70, 77–80, 88–92).
                  Like Kircher, those mathematicians did not fully succeed in finding unambiguous symbolic
                  represenations or state their proofs according to the same laws of rigor practiced
                  today.
                  Even today the closest we come to a symbolic language for manipulating music abstractly
                  may be MEI-XML; but that system still lacks full support for notating music of Kircher’s
                  era, and is designed for machines to use rather than humans
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#MEI">Music Encoding Initiative 2022</a>).

            <section id="sec-outline" class="unnumbered">
               <p>
                  In contrast with Kircher’s human-oriented design, the software implementation for
                  a digital automaton requires a complete, fully precise algorithm reducible to binary
                  numbers.
                  By number alone, the machine must build the ark, read the input, access the ark data,
                  transform it, and then write it in the output format.
                  The Haskell language with its pure-functional orientation guaranteed that the implementation
                  would be a single function (calling other nested functions), while its strict typing
                  made it possible to treat the required data structures as distinct data types.
                  The program uses the following modules:
                  </p>
               <dl>
                  <dt><code>Aedifico</code> (<q>I build</q>)</dt>

                  <dd>
                     This module stores the original data of Kircher’s ark in nested vectors and lists
                     of integer values and enumeration values corresponding to the rhythmic durations,
                     plus the lists of mode scales and other information.

                     This module creates the system for reading the input texts, which must be written
                     in a custom XML vocabulary.
                     The functions in this module extract the parameters like text meter, music meter,
                     and mode; and parse the text into sections, sentences, phrases, words, and syllables.

                     This module is where the actual <q>musarithmetic</q> occurs, where vperm numbers are converted into pitches with accidentals, rperms are
                     converted into durations, and octaves are set and adjusted according to Kircher’s
                     rules. 
                     The module stores all this data in internal data structures that encode music sections,
                     phrases, and pitches (with pitch class, octave, accidental, duration, and syllables).

                           This submodule includes the functions that calculate musical pitches (such as adding
                           pitches to shift octaves or subtracting to find and test intervals), and the functions
                           for setting the octaves of pitches in order to create an optimal sequence within a
                           given voice range.

                           Kircher’s rules in this area are underspecified, and as a result this is the most
                           experimental and interpretive component of the software.

                     The submodules output to MEI-XML, and there is also limited capacity for Lilypond

               <h1>3.1. The Ark in Haskell Data Types: Syntagmata, Pinakes, Perms</h1>
               <p>
                  The <code>Arca</code> data type contains the same information as the physical ark though slightly rearranged:
                  
                  <pre><code class="language-haskell">-- | A vector of 'Syntagma' instances plus the other elements of the physical
-- device (tone table, vocal ranges, information matching tones to pinakes)
-- makes up the full 'Arca'.
data Arca = Arca {
    perms      :: Vector (Syntagma),
    tones      :: ToneList,
    systems    :: ToneSystem,
    pinaxTones :: PinaxToneList,
    ranges     :: VoiceRanges
}
    </code></pre>
                  The <code>ranges</code> member holds the key information of the <em>Palimpsest phonotacticum</em> on the front of the box, while the <code>tones</code> and <code>systems</code> members correspond to the <em>Mensa tonographica</em> or tone table.
                  The member <code>pinaxTones</code> supplies the list of legal tones per pinax, which Kircher lists in various places.
                  The Haskell version of the tone table is optimized for quick lookup as a vector of
                  vectors, indexed by tone number and pitch number.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  The <code>perms</code> member of the <code>Arca</code> structure holds the pitch numbers and rhythmic durations from the pinakes.
                  This member stores the contents of the ark box—the syntagmata and pinakes—as a set
                  of nested vectors.
                  Each column is a data type with two members: one vector of vperms and one of rperms.
                  The rperms are further subdivided by meter.
                  At the bottom level, the pitch numbers are stored in lists of <code>Int</code> types, while the durations are members of a custom <code>Dur</code> enumerator type.
                  The following excerpts show how the Haskell data structures for rhythm permutations
                  fit within the hierarchy of data types:
                  
                  <pre><code class="language-haskell">type Syntagma   = Vector (Pinax)
type Pinax      = Vector (Column)
data Column     = Column {
    colVpermTable :: VpermTable, 
    colRpermTable :: RpermTable
}
type RpermTable = Vector (RpermMeter)

-- | An 'RpermMeter' includes a vector of 'RpermChoir's all in one meter (see
-- the 'MusicMeter' data type above) and the length of that vector, since
-- Kircher has a variable number of 'Rperm's in the different meters in each
-- column.
data RpermMeter = RpermMeter {
    rpermMax :: Int,            -- ^ length of 'rperms'
    rperms :: Vector (RpermChoir)
}

-- | In Syntagma I, there is only one set of rhythmic permutation that we
-- apply to all four voices of the 'VpermChoir'. But in Syntagma II, there are
-- groups of four 'Rperm's that match up with the four voices. 
-- So we make a "choir" as a vector of 'Rperm's, though in Syntagma I this
-- will always just have a single member.
type RpermChoir = Vector (Rperm)

-- | The bottom part of the "rods" contain tables of rhythmic values written
-- with musical notes. We implement this using our 'Dur' data type for the
-- rhythmic values. An 'Rperm' is a list of 'Dur' values.
type Rperm      = [Dur]

-- | Duration values: We use the mensural names; first the base values, then
-- dotted variants, then a series marked as rest values.
data Dur = 
      DurNil -- ^ unset
    | Lg     -- ^ longa
    | Br     -- ^ breve
    | Sb     -- ^ semibreve 
    | Mn     -- ^ minim
    | Sm     -- ^ semiminim
    | Fs     -- ^ fusa
    -- ...
    deriving (Enum, Eq, Ord, Show)
    </code></pre>
               </p>
               <p>
                  Using these data types, then, it is possible to build to ark using the data directly
                  from Kircher’s tables. 
                  The similarity between Kircher’s original encoding and that used in the program is
                  clear in this excerpt of the code for the first column of syntagma 1, pinax 4 (shown
                  in <a class="figref" href="#fig-s1p4">figure 2</a>), from the submodule <code>Arca_musarithmica.Syntagma1.Pinax04</code>:

                  The ark is built by converting these nested lists to the appropriate data types and
                  storing them in a single variable, <code>arca</code>, which is imported into the main program environment. 
                  To go in the other direction and access the vperm and rperm data, the program establishes
                  various forms of lookup functions to map the input parameters (style, text meter,
                  music meter, tone) to the relevant data.
                  For example, to select the proper pinax the computer looks up the text meter to find
                  a pinax label and then looks up the pinax label to find the vector index of that pinax
                  in its syntagma.
                  A number of inconsistencies in Kircher’s own structuring of the data and rules for
                  its access—for one, Syntagma I, Pinax 3 actually includes data for two different textual
                  meters—require explicit lookups rather than a simple mapping of enumeration tags to
                  vector indices.

               <p>
                  Before the digital Arca can use these data and algorithms to compose music, it must
                  read the input text prepared with all the information Kircher says is required.
                  The Haskell program accepts input files in a custom XML format, using certain elements
                  of the Text Encoding Initiative vocabulary
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#TEI">Text Encoding Initiative 2022</a>).
                  The file must have a <code>head</code> element with the title and author of the words, followed by a <code>text</code> element that includes the words to be set to music, in which the words are divided

                  The <code>Lectio</code> module provides the functions needed to parse this text and store it in internal
                  data structures for further processing.
                  These structures (including <code>Verbum</code> for a single word and <code>LyricPhrase</code> for a group of <code>Verbum</code>) store the text grouped in syllables and words, along with information about the
                  poetic length of each syllable and the penultimate length in each phrase.
                  The list of parsed phrase information is then passed on to the <code>Cogito</code> module for setting to music.

               <p>
                  The <code>arca</code> program, like Kircher’s original specification, assumes that its user is capable
                  of preparing the text as required and making the simple decisions about style, mood,
                  and musical meter.
                  The program does go one step further than Kircher does to automate the composition
                  of prose texts, though: where Kircher expects the human user to segment the text by
                  hand into chunks of two to six syllables, the program does this automatically for
                  input marked with <code>textMeter="Prose"</code>.
                  A smarter algorithm could certainly be designed, but this one groups the text into
                  the largest chunks possible and puts the longest groups toward the end; this avoids
                  too many choppy phrases and increases coherence.

                  Within <code>makeMusicPhrase</code>, the function <code>ark2voice</code> does the work of accessing the <q>musarithm</q> data for a specific voice (e.g., tenor) and transforming it into pitch classes and
                  durations in the appropriate tone.
                  The function <code>stepwiseVoiceInRange</code> sets the octaves for the pitch classes in order to produce an optimal voice leading
                  without illicit leaps.
                  These transformation steps involve the most challenging programming in the project
                  and reveal some of the difficulties inherent in Kircher’s specification.

               <p>
                  In the original system, before notating a pitch a user needed to know its letter name,
                  duration, and accidental; then the user had to choose the appropriate octave for the
                  pitch based on the range of a particular voice.
                  In the software these data make up the elements of the <code>Pitch</code> data type:
                  
                  <pre><code class="language-haskell">-- | A 'Pitch' stores the essential information for notating a single note.
data Pitch = Pitch {
    pnum  :: Pnum,          -- ^ Enum for diatonic pitch number
    oct   :: Int,           -- ^ Helmholtz system, middle C = 4
    dur   :: Dur,           -- ^ Duration, one of @Dur@ enum
    accid :: Accid,         -- ^ Accidental
    accidType :: AccidType  -- ^ Type of accidental for display
                            --   ('Written', 'Implicit', or 'Suggested')

               <p>
                  Everything but the octave is pulled directly from the pinax and the tone table.
                  Setting the octave, however, requires more computing than it might seem, and in fact
                  more than Kircher specifies.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Once again, we see a marked difference between computation devices designed for human
                  operators as opposed to what a digital machine requires. 
                  Kircher’s original <em>palimpsest phonotacticum</em> is effectively a graphical computing device for setting the octave of pitches.
                  Before matching a pitch name and rhythm, Kircher tells the user to write a temporary
                  dot on the appropriate staff line as shown on the illustration affixed to the front
                  of the ark.
                  Having located the right series of rhythmic durations, the user is to copy the symbol
                  onto the staff in place of the dot.
                  Kircher does not provide rules for choosing between multiple valid pitch-classes within
                  range; he only says that the user should find the next closest pitch that is on the
                  staff.
                  The ark’s chart of staves with clefs, signatures for <em>cantus durus</em> or <em>mollis</em>, and pitch names written on the lines establishes the possible range and gamut of
                  pitches for a particular voice.
                  A cantus part with a C1 clef, might range from C<sub>3</sub> to F<sub>5</sub> if limited to notes actually on the staff.
                  With a <em>cantus mollis</em> (one flat) signature all the Bs in that range are flat.
                  To set the octave for a pitch, then—to know which line to place the dot on—one simply
                  selects from any of that pitch class within range.
                  To find the next pitch, one calculates geometrically the shortest distance on the
                  staff-line graph from the previous pitch to the new pitch, provided that the new pitch
                  is still in range.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Kircher does not give a precise definition of the ranges, but in practice he will
                  extend up to a single ledger line above or below the staves.
                  That would give the voices the following ranges, which are used in the software (in
                  the <code>_vocalRanges</code> member of the <code>arca</code> structure):

                  Even for a human operator, though, this simple algorithm is not sufficient to establish
                  optimal voice leading within the range.
                  In Kircher’s written-out realizations of the musarithms, he does not in fact always
                  choose the smaller interval.
                  Especially in the bass, he sometimes opts for an ascending fifth (especially moving
                  to the final) rather than a descending fourth.
                  Posing more of a problem are those permutations in which there is a long sequence
                  of stepwise movements in one direction (as in <a class="figref" href="#ex-Ave_maris_stella-florid">example 2</a>), because if the tone transposes this sequence to a position that overlaps the range
                  boundary, it is impossible to realize it without either going out of range or turning
                  a second into a seventh.
                  Kircher warns against intervals that are too large but does not define them precisely.
                  Human users would have need at least a little musical knowledge to resolve these situations
                  on paper.

                  Kircher’s specifications were not sufficient to translate them into a computer program.
                  Instead the <code>Cogito.Musarithmetic</code> module provides the function <code>stepwiseVoiceInRange</code>, which attempts to capture in programming logic the intuitive steps a human user
                  would follow to evaluate the different possible realizations of a vperm in a given
                  range.

                  list containing all the possible octave values for each pitch.
                  Because we know that we might need to go out of range in the end, we first expand
                  the permissible range by a third in each direction.
                  From these permutations we construct a tree (implemented as a left-child/right-sibling
                  binary tree) of every possible permutation of pitches, ending a branch if the interval
                  between parent and child is illegal.
                  We define a legal leap as any interval less than a seventh, or an octave.

                  The function does what Kircher says it should do, just in a different way.
                  Kircher’s graphical system would need to be adapted to a numeric one in any case;
                  but the program required more specific rules than he provided to evaluate the possibilities.
                  It obviates the need for some of the makeshift remedies that Kircher provides in place
                  of a rigorous algorithm, which include swapping voices.

               <h1>3.5. Accidentals and Church Keys</h1>
               <p>
                  The other area in which the software must fill in an incomplete specification is the
                  problem of setting the accidental for each pitch.
                  Kircher’s tone table only provides potential accidentals, to be applied according
                  to <em>musica ficta</em> conventions in each <em>tonus</em>.
                  In practice, the problem of accidentals is a major detriment to making the ark fully
                  automatic, regardless of whether the operator is electronic or human.
                  From Kircher’s table of twelve <em>toni ecclesiastici</em>, accidentals are derived from the designation of each tone as being in <em>cantus durus</em> or <em>mollis</em>, and from the accidentals included with the pitch numbers.
                  <em>Cantus durus</em> meant there were no accidentals in the signature and the tones were untransposed
                  (tones I on D); <em>cantus mollis</em> meant there was one B flat in the signature and the tones were transposed down a
                  fifth (mode I on G).
                  Kircher does provide some rules for when to apply his suggested accidentals, but he
                  also gives examples where additional accidentals must be added, and his own notated
                  examples contradict his specifications.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  The accidental problem arises not just because of Kircher’s incomplete instructions,
                  but because of the structure of the tone table itself.
                  Kircher’s table and his rules for using it represent an underappreciated attempt to
                  theorize the rapidly changing, chaotic state of modal and harmonic practice in the
                  seventeenth century.
                  Previous scholars have seen Kircher’s tones too simply in terms of modes or keys
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Chierotti:KircherComporre">Chierotti 1994</a>; 
                  <a class="bibref" href="#Bumgardner:Kircher">Bumgardner 2009</a>; 
                  <a class="bibref" href="#Bohnert:Kircher">Bohnert 2010</a>).
                  Kircher actually blurs the distinction between the twelve modes defined by Glarean
                  and Zarlino, and the new system of <em>toni ecclesiastici</em> or <q>church keys</q>
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Barnett:TonalOrganization17C">Barnett 2002</a>). 
                  The latter developed in part from keyboardists’ practices of playing
                  polyphonic intonations for the eight traditional psalm tones of Gregorian chant, but
                  more and more musicians were coming to think of <q>tone</q> as something like a key.
                  Meanwhile there was a separate way of understanding mode in polyphonic composition,
                  based primarily on the final in the lowest voice and the ambitus of the tenor voice
                  (plagal or authentic).
                  But there also was a growing tendency in the seventeenth century to speak prescriptively
                  of mode as dictating not just the final but also patterns of internal cadences as
                  well as character and affect.
                  Performers using <em>musica ficta</em> practices tended to raise <q>leading tones</q> at cadences and sharp thirds at the ends of phrases, and with these adjustments along
                  with greater emphasis on bass-line movements by fifth and other elements of tonality,
                  the <em>toni</em> increasingly came to resemble either major or minor keys.  
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Most of the other seventeenth-century classification systems that Barnett describes
                  feature eight church keys instead of Kircher’s twelve.
                  Perhaps Kircher was trying to combine the concepts of mode, tone, and church key,
                  or perhaps he did not understand the difference; either way, as Barnett notes, he
                  was hardly alone in his confusion.
                  Practice was changing rapidly and no one had yet provided a consistent theory.
                  The way Kircher codifies the tone system in the Arca should be understood as his contribution
                  to harmonic theory, imperfect as it is.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  The tone table is typical of Kircher’s paradoxes: he maintains that there are twelve
                  tones out of faithfulness to tradition, but he also recognizes that the traditional
                  approach does not fully address modern practice.
                  As in other parts of the book his attempt to synthesize old and new results in something
                  that neither ancients or moderns would recognize.
                  Although composers of the time wrote differently in each mode or tone, Kircher’s system
                  simply transposes the same voice-leading patterns.
                  Had he used full key signatures instead of suggested accidentals, Kircher would have
                  produced something close to the modern system of transposable major and minor keys.
                  As it is, Kircher must limit the selection of tones that can be used with certain
                  pinakes, because not every voice-leading pattern works in every tone, given the different
                  pattern of intervals in each.
                  Kircher saw a variety of <em>toni</em> as necessary for conveying distinct affective influences to listeners, and a system
                  with only major or minor keys would have broken consistency with centuries-old traditions
                  of modal affect associations.
                  Kircher’s system actually highlights the affective impact of distinct <em>toni</em>, because the same musarithm pattern can produce markedly different effects depending
                  on the interval and accidental pattern of the chosen tone.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Moreover, the user is also supposed to add other accidentals as needed in order to
                  avoid illicit melodic intervals in the bass, and thereby to avoid bad harmonic intervals
                  above the bass.
                  The basic rules according to Kircher are these: make all Bs flat if the tone is in
                  <em>cantus mollis</em>; before adjusting the other voices one must first adjust the bass voice according
                  to a table he provides to avoid illicit intervals (changing B–F to B<span class="music">♭</span>–F, for example).
                  Then in the upper voice apply the accidentals by rule: 
                  <span class="music">♭</span><span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">6</span></span>; in the table is always flat, but Kircher says that where there is a <span class="music">♯</span><span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">7</span></span> in the tone table, the user should only apply the sharp when the voice is ascending
                  to <span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">8</span></span>.
                  In his realizations, though, he goes beyond these rules: sometimes he raises a <span class="music">♭</span><span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">6</span></span>, often he writes a <span class="music">♯</span><span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">3</span></span> at cadences, and there are numerous other exceptions. 
                  Many corner cases are unclear, such as the common idiom in the florid syntagma II
                  of <span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">7</span></span>–<span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">6</span></span>–<span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">8</span></span> in tones with <span class="music">♯</span><span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">7</span></span> and <span class="music">♭</span><span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">6</span></span>.
                  What if one voice has <span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">6</span></span>–<span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">7</span></span>–<span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">8</span></span> while another voice (in a voice-exchange pattern) has <span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">8</span></span>–<span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">7</span></span>–<span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">6</span></span>?
                  The top voice would have <span class="music">♯</span><span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">7</span></span> according to Kircher’s simple rule, but the lower voice would have <span class="music">♮</span><span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">7</span></span> at the same time, making an unacceptable cross relation. 
                  It would not be hard for a competent musician of the time to resolve such cases, but
                  Kircher does not provide enough information for a true Tyro to complete this complex
                  task mechanically.
                  The software implementation uses the rules Kircher does provide but expands them,
                  using a multiple pass system to adjust the accidentals in layers.
                  We first adjust the bass line (including fixing tritones, avoiding <span class="music">♯</span><span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">7</span></span> when it is not moving to 
                  <span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">8</span></span>), then adjust the upper voices based on their own internal patterns (raising <span class="scaleDegree"><span class="hat">ˆ</span><span class="under-hat">7</span></span> when ascending).
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Then we adjust the upper voices relative to the bass, and finally adjust the upper
                  voices relative to each other.
                  The adjustments fix cross relations and impossible intervals like an augmented fifth
                  between bass and upper voice.

                  The automatic setting of <cite>O ter quaterque felix cicada</cite> (<a class="figref" href="#ex-Stephanus">example 3</a>) demonstrates a successful output in tone 1 with florid counterpoint.
                  The small accidentals above the staff are the result of <em>ficta</em> adjustments: sharps and flats show where the program has applied Kircher’s suggested
                  accidentals; naturals show where it has canceled them.
                  The current algorithm does not handle every case appropriately, but does avoid the
                  most egregious problems.
                  It still remains unclear whether with enough rules the program could automatically
                  produce stylistically appropriate music, or whether some features of Kircher’s tone
                  system and musarithm patterns make that impossible.

                  In Kircher’s final stage, the user simply copied the music symbols onto staff-ruled
                  paper, but the computer implementation encodes the musical output so that other programs
                  may render it visible and audible.
                  This project uses the XML format of the Music Encoding Initiative, which may easily

                  The software system, then, translates two sources of encoded data—the input text encoded
                  in XML, and the ark data encoded in Kircher’s vperm and rperm tables—into a third
                  encoding system.

                  The program’s <code>Note</code> data type was designed to map easily onto the MEI <code>note</code> element, which combines pitch information with a syllable text.
                  The members of the <code>Pitch</code> structure translate directly to the XML attributes or subelements of the MEI <code>note</code> To render the whole <code>Phrase</code> (one line of input text, set to music by the ark) into MEI, we map <code>note2mei</code> over the phrase and add barlines at the <code>section</code> divisions marked in the input text.
                  The program takes advantage of MEI’s alternative mensural mode, in which music may
                  be structured one voice (MEI <code>layer</code>) at a time rather than being organized by measure.
                  The web application uses Verovio to render the MEI to graphical notation (SVG)
                  and sound (via MIDI).
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Putting all these elements together, the application’s main function builds the ark,
                  reads and parses the input text, and generates a list of random numbers to select
                  permutations for each phrase.
                  The function <code>makeMusicScore</code> generates the music and <code>score2mei</code> to converts the internal data structures to MEI output.
                  This is the central portion of the application:
                  
                  <pre><code class="language-haskell">main :: IO ()

let 
    score = makeMusicScore arca sections perms 
    mei   = score2mei arca metadata score

                  The simple web app wraps a convenient user interface around the Haskell program to
                  enable users to select either fully prepared input texts, or make their own choices
                  about style, tone (based on mood), and meter.

                  In sum, even before its implementation as a computer program, Kircher’s Arca musarithmica
                  was already a computational system.
                  The Arca includes multiple kinds of structured data and algorithms, and in the words
                  of Niklaus Wirth’s memorable title, <cite>Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs</cite>
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Wirth:Algorithms">Wirth 1976</a>).
                  The system does not meet every modern definition of a computer, since its its data
                  structures are not always consistent and its algorithms not completely specified.
                  Considered as a physical device with a human operator, though, Kircher’s system is
                  reasonably optimized and specified fully enough that most people capable of reading
                  the Latin instructions would be able to follow the steps and with enough patience,
                  generate a composition.
                  The ark’s structure makes the process nearly automatic for a human user, including
                  the visual indexing of the box’s internal structure, the ability to physically move
                  and rearrange the pinakes in their order of use, and the <em>palimpsest</em> system for finding in-range pitches graphically.
                  For Kircher’s learned readers, parsing and metrifying a Latin poetic text would not
                  perhaps have been an obstacle, but some of the musical decisions required to achieve
                  optimal stepwise voice leading and appropriate accidentals would require more knowledge
                  than an <em>amusicus</em> would have.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  The digital implementation demonstrates that with some modifications Kircher’s system
                  can be made to work as a single function transforming an input text and parameters
                  into an output of encoded music.
                  Most of the modifications are just implementation details needed for a user that at
                  base level only understands arithmetic, Boolean conditionals, and memory registers,
                  though we have seen there are also several areas where greater specification was needed.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Being written as a Haskell program clarifies the structure of flows from input to
                  output.
                  Every function in the program includes a signature showing a series of data types
                  moving from input to output. 
                  The arguments to the initial function are shown in series because Haskell functions
                  are actually curried: functions with multiple arguments are actually composed from
                  a series of functions, each of which receives a single input and returns a single
                  output.
                  The <code>arca</code> program’s primary function takes as input the ark data, the processed input text,
                  and the random permutation numbers, and outputs a data structure for the entire music
                  score:
                  
                  <pre><code class="language-haskell">-- | Compose the music for the whole document as a 'MusicScore', 
--   pulling the data from the 'Arca'.
makeMusicScore :: Arca -&gt; [LyricSection] -&gt; [SectionPerm] -&gt; MusicScore
makeMusicScore arca lyricSections sectionPerms = 
    zipWith (makeMusicChorus arca) lyricSections sectionPerms 
</code></pre>
               </p>
               <p>
                  The flow of inputs to outputs in the digital implementation is the same as in
                  the physical system.
                  The chart in <a class="figref" href="#fig-flows">figure 4</a> focuses on the output of a single note, ignoring the larger structural divisions.
                  The chart does not account for the adjustments we must make only after we have put
                  together the whole series of notes (setting the octave and accidentals based on intervals
                  between notes).
                  </p>

               </figure>
               <p>
                  Many of the flows in the chart can be seen clearly in the <code>pair2pitch</code> function, which takes the pair of pitch and rhythm values from the ark tables and
                  returns a <code>Pitch</code> data structure that includes pitch name, accidental, octave, and duration:

            oct       = 4, -- dummy value, will be adjusted
            dur       = thisDur
        } 
        thisPnum       = (snd pair) - 1 -- adjust to 0 index

        thisPnumInTone = fst tonePitch
        thisAccid      = snd tonePitch
        tonePitch      = pnumAccidInTone thisPnum toneList tone

</code></pre>
               </p>
               <p>
                  The <code>arca</code> program is as faithful to Kircher’s original design as possible, but it also surpasses
                  the incomplete specification to become a true, fully automatic composition machine.
                  Thus an erstwhile <q>recipe box</q> full of tables, taken along with Kircher’s written specifications, has become a single,
                  complete algorithm for computing music.

               <h1>4.1. The Ark as Encapsulation of Compositional Knowledge</h1>
               <p>
                  If music can be composed mechanically using the Arca, then, what does this tell us
                  about how Kircher and his contemporaries understood composition?
                  When Kircher says his goal is to create a system for <q>artificial</q> (<em>artificiosus</em>) composition, he is using the word in an early modern sense where <em>art</em> more readily connotes a practice or technique. 
                  The seventeenth-century European or colonial composer was, in modern terms, more an
                  artisan than an artist. 
                  An artificial system would be one built on artifice, one created by tools and ingenuity
                  rather than a natural part of the created world.
                  The point of artifice was to imitate the natural world, to draw out its latent patterns
                  and order.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  The basic principle of the ark is to arrange pre-formulated patterns into a new combination,
                  and as Chierotti argues, this practice is none other than the rhetorician’s art of
                  <em>dispositio</em> 
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Chierotti:KircherComporre">Chierotti 1994</a>, 407–409).
                  In the Classical practice of preparing a speech (derived from authorities like Quintillian
                  and Cicero) that stage of arranging an argument was preceded by <em>inventio</em>, coming up with an idea.
                  It may seem that the ark eliminates this first step by providing a set of musical
                  ideas which only need to be combined, obviating any expressive or communicative role
                  of the human creator, but such a view would stem from a modern concept of <q>invention</q> as original creation.
                  In Kircher’s day, invention meant as much <q>discovery</q> as creativity.  
                  One had to <em>find</em> the ideas, and the artisan’s craft was displayed in how the craftsman manipulated
                  existing materials. 
                  A carpenter needed a pattern, tools, and lumber to begin, but his reputation depended
                  on his ability to turn the raw materials into a finished product according to the
                  plans.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Recent research has shown that European musicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth
                  centuries, as late as J. S. Bach and Mozart, constructed their music from pre-existing
                  patterns, according to well-known, standard techniques
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Dreyfus:BachInvention">Dreyfus 1996</a>;
                  <a class="bibref" href="#Gjerdingen:Galant">Gjerdingen 2007</a>).
                  Gjerdingen has shown that composers trained in eighteenth-century Neapolitan conservatories
                  were taught to build up a repertoire of conventional voice-leading patterns and to
                  assemble these, with elaboration, into full compositions. 
                  Using such practical methods did not inhibit composers from conveying sophisticated
                  poetic concepts and creating dramatic effects; instead, they actually enabled that
                  communication by appealing to common tropes familiar to a community of listeners
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Cashner:Segovia">Cashner 2022a</a>).
                  Completely apart from its status as a computational system, Kircher’s Arca merits
                  study as a repository of conventional mid-seventeenth century voice-leading patterns.
                  
                  </p>
               <p>
                  In this light, then, Kircher’s device fits well within an early modern concept of
                  musical craft. 
                  As a human-operated system, preserving the user’s ability to choose permutations intelligently
                  and adjust them with discretion, the ark merely codifies and reduces the set of combinations
                  available to the user and makes it easier for the human composer to <q>find</q> them. 
                  By ensuring that each individual combination is already a coherent and rule-compliant
                  musical idea (<em>inventio</em>), and by providing an algorithm for arranging the ideas (<em>dispositio</em>), the ark eases the burden of a human operator, who no longer has to check each bar
                  for such errors as parallel fifths or octaves. 
                  (This would be even more effective if Kircher himself had successfully avoided such
                  errors in the ark.)
                  In that way the ark fulfills the same purpose as other computing devices, from multiplication
                  tables through Napier’s bones and slide rules, which is to reduce the number of calculations
                  required by storing pre-calculated results.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Kircher’s procedure of finding appropriate music for one phrase of text at a time
                  does correspond to the text-setting practice of many composers of his age.
                  On the other hand, the lack of any motivic connection between the permutations contradicts
                  a core principle of rhetoric, that an oration should focus on one central theme.
                  For master musicians of Kircher’s time, applying that principle to music meant carrying
                  a single idea (<q>invention</q>) or motive throughout a work 
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Jacobson:BuxtehudeRhetoric">Jacobson 1982</a>).
                  This discrepancy between Kircher’s stated rhetorical ideal and actual contemporary
                  musical-rhetorical practice reflects a tension throughout the <cite>Musurgia</cite> between the idea of music as an orderly, rule-based system, and the idea of music
                  as a form of rhetoric and an expression of human
                  passions.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  If Kircher’s system reflects widespread attitudes about composition, therefore, it
                  also reflects widespread misunderstandings.
                  The fact that composers communicated with existing conventions does not mean that
                  their work was purely mechanical. 
                  The task of creating music could not be reduced to numerical calculation, and Kircher’s
                  system does not in fact succeed in doing so. 
                  The machine does something with music that is analogous to mathematical calculation,
                  but it also demonstrates the limits of trying to reduce music to pure number.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  The gap between theory and practice also shows when trying to take up Kircher
                  on his promise that the Arca may be used to set texts in any language.
                  Kircher hoped that his fellow Jesuit priests in overseas missions could use the Arca
                  to generate music in local languages
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Kircher:Musurgia">Kircher 1650</a>, II: 126–141).
                  The <code>arca</code> program does show that this is technically possible.
                  The Shakespeare text <q>If Music Be the Food of Love, Play On</q> (from <cite>The Tempest</cite>) included on the website demonstrates the ark’s ability to set non-Latin texts with
                  reasonably good results.
                  Though finding or creating non-Latin texts that fit one of Kircher’s Classical meters
                  is a major impediment, if the <code>textMeter</code> is set to <code>Prose</code>, the program will automatically set any kind of text.
                  As a manual system, though, Kircher’s Arca cannot have proved very useful to the pragmatic
                  needs of missionary priests in Goa or Nagasaki.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Kircher was never strong on practicalities, in any case, and I would argue that his
                  real goal for the Arca was to encapsulate universal musical knowledge in one device.
                  This idea of epitomizing all knowledge of a domain through describing an imaginary
                  computing device is echoed in many respects by Donald Knuth’s invention of <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix.html">the MIX computer</a> in <cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite>, especially given that Knuth’s first major application of the device is to permutations
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Knuth:TAOCP1">Knuth 1997</a>, 124–144, 164–175).
                  The Arca epitomizes the overall theological argument of the <cite>Musurgia</cite> that music embodies the order of God’s creation and reflects the perfection of God’s
                  nature, while it also has a powerful effect on the human body and soul, and serves
                  as a form of communication and expresssion.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  Like many of his seventeenth-century contemporaries, Kircher understood music as <q>sounding number</q>, an embodiment of the mathematical order inherent in God’s created universe, and
                  a reflection of the perfection of God himself. 
                  The Puebla copy of the Arca musarithmica is preserved in a manuscript miscellany of
                  notes on mathematical subjects, including geometry (with attempts to solve the impossible
                  problems of squaring the circle and trisecting the angle), astrology, chronology,
                  and tax accounting
                  (<a class="bibref" href="#Cashner:KircherSpanish">Cashner 2022b</a>).
                  All of those forms of speculation and inquiry involved number in the attempt to trace
                  hidden patterns of connection, and this is what Sor Juana termed <q>Kircherizing</q>.
                  Out of the infinite variety of possible combinations of notes and rhythms, the user
                  of the ark selects a specific set of permutations and thus imitates God in his original
                  act of creation.
                  </p>
               <p>
                  In this digital implementation, the Arca musarithmica not only enables someone with
                  no knowledge of music to compose, as Kircher intended; it also brings to life a forgotten
                  body of musical knowledge.
                  The ark encodes pre-calculated knowledge of seventeenth-century music, a library of
                  musical invention, that generates output that one of Kircher’s Roman contemporaries
                  like Carissimi would probably have recognized as music, even if somewhat monotonous
                  and with occasional quirks and errors.
                  There are manifold possibilities for extending Kircher’s design, including using machine-learning
                  techniques to improve the permutation data or the composition process, and even replacing
                  the pinax tables with music in other styles or metrical patterns better suited to
                  other languages.
                  The machine-readable MEI output of the Arca program could be analyzed by computer
                  and compared to other digitized corpora, which might even reveal the sources for Kircher’s
                  permutations.
                  With a digital implementation accessible to anyone on the Internet, musical Tyros
                  and experts alike can do what Kircher hoped, and with no more work or knowledge than
                  the click of a few buttons, they can generate and hear limitless permutations of never-before-heard,
                  newly composed seventeenth-century music.
