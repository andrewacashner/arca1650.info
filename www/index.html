        This site presents a digital implentation of device for automatic
        music composition invented by Athanasius Kircher in 1650.
        Based on the specifications in Kircher’s <cite>Musurgia
          universalis</cite> (Rome, 1650), Book VIII, the core program was
        written in Haskell (2021), with a simple web interface in Javascript
        and PHP.

        <h1>An <q>Ark</q> of Musical Knowledge in Infinite Permutations</h1>

        <p>
        The <em>Arca musarithmica</em> Athanasii Kircherii MDCL</em> is an ark
        or box for <q>music-arithmetic</q>, or musical calculation. The ark
        holds a set of data tables, which together with a list of rules for
        how to use the tables, amounts to a computation device for composing
        music. Given input in the form of a marked text in Latin and a small
        set of simple choices about the musical setting, a user who knows
        nothing about music can use the ark to generate unique,
        never-before-heard musical settings of that text for four-voice (SATB)
        chorus.
        </p>
        <p>
        Kircher presented this as an embodiment of mathematical permutations.
        Like many of his seventeenth-century contemporaries, he understood music
        as <q>sounding number,</q> an embodiment of the mathematical order
        inherent in God’s created universe, and a reflection of the perfection
        of God himself. Out of the infinite variety of possible combinations of
        notes and rhythms, the user of the ark selects a specific set of
        permutations and thus imitates God in his original act of creation.
        </p>
        <p>
        The combination of structured data and completely prescribed
        algorithms makes Kircher’s device a computational system, with some of
        the characteristics that would later characterize modern computers,
        though of course Kircher had no way to automate his system and
        certainly did not theorize it fully.
        This implementation, written in the pure-functional programming
        language Haskell, models the entire ark as a single mathematical
        function: it takes one series of symbols, representing an input text
        and the choice of musical parameters, and transforms those into
        another set of symbols that represents musical notation.
        Though others have implemented portions of the ark and related
        systems (see the <a href="about.html#biblio">bibliography</a>), to my
        knowledge this is the version to be fully automatic and to be capable
        of setting texts of any length and type.
        </p>
        <p>
        Kircher intended his device for the total musical novice, a
        <q>Tyro</q> who knew <em>nothing</em> about music except the rules he
        provided. Kircher did not know it, but he was describing an automatic
        computer. All we have done is create a digital version of his ark that
        an electronic computer, the ultimate know-nothing, can use to generate
        music.
        </p>
        <p>
        The program and its output make it possible to reflect on what
        Kircher’s project meant: What does his <q>artificial</q> system of
        composition tell us about his and his contemporaries’ concepts of both
        music and computation?
        How much musical knowledge is embodied in this device? What is
        missing? 
        And what purposes would such a device have served in its time?
        While I continue to search for answers to these questions, please
        explore this project and 
        <a href="mailto:andrew.cashner@rochester.edu">reach out</a> 
        with questions and ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
        Run the ark as many times as you like and create ever-new, unique
        musical combinations!
