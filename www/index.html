        This site presents <a href="http://www.andrewcashner.com/">Andrew Cashner</a>’s digital implementation of a device for automatic music composition invented by Athanasius Kircher in 1650, along with research about the device and its history.
        Based on the specifications in Kircher’s <cite>Musurgia
          universalis</cite> (Rome, 1650), Book VIII, the core program was
        written in Haskell (2021), with a simple web interface in Javascript
        and PHP.
