        <p>
        This site presents a digital recreation of device for automatic music
        composition invented by Athanasius Kircher in 1650.
        Based on the specifications in Kircher’s <cite>Musurgia
          universalis</cite> (Rome, 1650), Book VIII, this software
        implementation is the most comprehensive realization of this system in
        software. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The core program was written in Haskell 
        by <a href="http://www.andrewcashner.com/">Andrew Cashner</a>
        (Rochester, New York, 2021), with a simple web interface in Javascript
        and PHP.

        <h1>An <q>Ark</q> of Musical Knowledge in Infinite Permutations</h1>

        <p>
        The <em>Arca musarithmica</em> Athanasii Kircherii MDCL</em> is an ark
        or box for <q>music-arithmetic</q>. The ark holds a set of data
        tables, which together with a list of rules for how to use the tables,
        amounts to a computation device for composing music. Given input in
        the form of a marked text in Latin and a small set of simple choices
        about the musical setting, a user who knows nothing about music can
        use the ark to generate completely unique, never-before-heard musical
        settings of that text for four-voice (SATB) chorus.
        </p>
        <p>
        Kircher presented this as an embodiment of mathematical permutations.
        Like many of his seventeenth-century contemporaries, he understood music
        as <q>sounding number,</q> an embodiment of the mathematical order
        inherent in God’s created universe, and a reflection of the perfection
        of God himself. Out of the infinite variety of possible combinations of
        notes and rhythms, the user of the ark selects a specific set of
        permutations and thus imitates God in his original act of creation.
        </p>

        <p>The combination of structured data and completely prescribed
        algorithms makes Kircher’s device a kind of <strong>music computer</strong>.
        This implementation, written in the pure-functional programming language
        Haskell, demonstrates that the entire ark can be modeled in terms of
        mathematical functions using lambda calculus. 
        It takes one series of symbols, representing an input text and the
        choice of musical parameters, and transforms those into another set of
        symbols that represents musical notation.</p>
        <p>Kircher intended his device for the total musical novice, a
        <q>Tyro</q> who knew <em>nothing</em> about music except the rules he
        provided. Kircher did not know it, but he was describing an automatic
        computer. All we have done is create a digital version of his ark that
        an electronic computer, the ultimate know-nothing, can use to generate
        music.</p>
        <p>Run the ark as many times as you like and create ever-new, unique
        musical combinations!</p>
