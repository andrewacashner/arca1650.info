        <h2>Who Built the Arca and Why?</h2>
        <p>
        The <em>Arca musarithmica</em> or <q>box of music-numbers</q> is a
        computation device invented by Athanasius Kircher.
        Kircher (1602–1680) was a German-born Jesuit priest and polymath in
        Rome who also wrote books about optics, magnetism, geology, and
        Egyptian hieroglyphics and corresponded with a global network of
        scientists, scholars, and missionaries.
        In book VIII of his treatise <cite>Musurgia universalis</cite> (Rome,
        1650), Kircher promised that the device could automatically generate
        musical settings for four-voice chorus of any given text, in any
        language.
        The Arca could generate music in several styles, from a simple homophonic texture like a hymn to a complex fugal texture, all by combining preset permutations of musical patterns.
        Though the Arca did not have an automatic mechanism, a user could produce coherent output solely by following Kircher’s rules, without knowing anything about music.
        </p>
        <p>
        The ark holds a set of data tables, which together with a list of rules
        for how to use the tables, amounts to a computation device for
        composing music. Given input in the form of a marked text in Latin and
        a small set of simple choices about the musical setting, a user who
        knows nothing about music can use the ark to generate unique,
        never-before-heard musical settings of that text for four-voice (SATB)
        chorus.
        </p>
        <p>
        Kircher presented this as an embodiment of mathematical permutations.
        Like many of his seventeenth-century contemporaries, he understood music
        as <q>sounding number,</q> an embodiment of the mathematical order
        inherent in God’s created universe, and a reflection of the perfection
        of God himself. Out of the infinite variety of possible combinations of
        notes and rhythms, the user of the ark selects a specific set of
        permutations and thus imitates God in his original act of creation.
        </p>
        <p>
        The combination of structured data and completely prescribed
        algorithms makes Kircher’s device a computational system, with some of
        the characteristics that would later characterize modern computers,
        though of course Kircher had no way to automate his system and
        certainly did not theorize it fully.
        This implementation, written in the pure-functional programming
        language Haskell, models the entire ark as a single mathematical
        function: it takes one series of symbols, representing an input text
        and the choice of musical parameters, and transforms those into
        another set of symbols that represents musical notation.
        Though others have implemented portions of the ark and related
        systems (see the <a href="about.html#biblio">bibliography</a>), to my
        knowledge this is the first version to be fully automatic and to be
        capable of setting texts of any length and type.
        </p>
        <p>
        The program and its output make it possible to reflect on what
        Kircher’s project meant: What does his <q>artificial</q> system of
        composition tell us about his and his contemporaries’ concepts of both
        music and computation?
        How much musical knowledge is embodied in this device? What is
        missing? 
        And what purposes would such a device have served in its time?

      <section id="how-to">
        <h2>How Did the Arca Work?</h1>

        <ol>
          <li>Kircher expects you to <strong>prepare a text</strong> in Latin or
            another language, with words divided into syllables, marked long or
            short. You can set texts in several Classical meters (like
            Anacreontic or Sapphic), but you can also set irregular verse and
            prose texts.  <ul>
              <li>In this web app, we provide a set of <strong>pre-marked
                  texts</strong>.</li>
              <li>With the command-line version, you can create your own texts
                that might even have multiple sections in different styles and
                moods!</li>
            </ul>
          </li> 
          <li>Next, Kircher wants you to choose several aspects of the music
            setting you want the ark to create:
            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>style</strong> and texture of the music:
                <ol>
                  <li>you can opt for simple, note-against-note counterpoint (like a
                    hymn),</li>
                  <li>or florid, melismatic counterpoint (like a motet, anthem, or
                    even fugue).</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>The <strong>mood</strong> or character of the text and its
                setting, which determines the choice of one of twelve musical
                <q>tones</q> or <q>church keys</q> (<em>toni
                  ecclesiastici</em>). 
                The tones are not the same as modern keys, nor do they match
                up exactly with the medieval modes used to classify
                plainchant.
                They seem to be a hybrid of the polyphonic <q>tones</q> used
                by keyboardists to introduce and accompany the eight
                traditional chant psalm tones, with the twelve-mode system
                introduced by the earlier theorists Glarean and Zarlino.
                (see <a href="#Barnett:TonalOrganization17C">Barnett 2002</a>).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>The <strong>musical meter</strong> (technically, mensuration)
                of the setting. 
                <ol>
                  <li>In the simple style, you can choose 
                    <ol>
                      <li>duple meter (cut C),</li>
                      <li>triple minor (C3, three minims/half notes per metrical
                        unit),</li>
                      <li>or triple major (cut C3, three semibreves/whole notes
                        per metrical unit).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                    Some duple-meter permutations in the ark have a minim pulse
                    (C) and others have a semibreve pulse (cut C).
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>In florid style, everything is in duple meter (C).</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If you are operating the ark by hand, you use these input
            parameters to select the proper tables. 
            <ul> 
              <li><strong>Syntagma:</strong> There are three <em>syntagmata</em>
                or large divisions in the ark. For simple style, you select from
                Syntagma I; for florid, use Syntagma II.
                <p>
                Kircher provides a third syntagma as well, but because it would
                be much more difficult if not impossible to make completely
                automatic, we have omitted it from this implementation.
                (An exercise for the reader!)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Pinax:</strong> Each syntagma containes a set of
                <q>rods</q> or <em>pinakes</em> (singular, <em>pinax</em>). You
                select the <em>pinax</em> based on the meter of the text.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Column:</strong> Each pinax contain
                several columns of data. The column is either a free choice, or
                is based on the order of lines in the poem.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Voice and rhythm permutations:</strong> Each column
                includes two parts: sets of numbers representing musical pitches
                (we call these <q>voice permutations</q> or vperms), and sets of
                musical notes representing rhythmic durations (<q>rhythm
                  permutations</q> or rperms).
                <ul>
                  <li>In syntagma I (simple counterpoint), the user is supposed
                    to freely choose one set of vperms and one set of
                    rperms. All the musical voices use the same rhythms.
                    <ul>
                      <li>In syntagma I, there are (generally) three sets of
                        rhythm permutation, one for each type of musical meter
                        you can use.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>In syntagma II (florid counterpoint), there is a set of
                      rperms that matches up with each vperm, so that there is a
                      specified rhythm for each of the SATB voices. This makes
                      independent contrapuntal voices possible.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                  </li>
            </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Writing the  music down:</strong> Next you lay out what
                Kircher calls the <em>palimpsest phontacticum</em>, or what the rest
                of us call <q>music paper</q>.
                You draw out four staves and put an appropriate combination of clefs
                for the four voices. These determine the octave and range of the
                musical output for each voice. You also add a flat in the key
                signature if your tone is in <em>cantus mollis</em> according to the
                table, and add the appropriate mensuration sign.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Matching pitches, rhythms, and syllables:</strong> For
                each phrase of text, you take the pitch numbers and look them up in
                the table for the given tone in order to get note names. You pair
                these note names with the rhythmic values, or just put rests when
                those are given. You write these values on the staff,
                making certain adjustments as needed.
              </li>
              <li>Kircher describes a variety of <strong>adjustments</strong>, some
                of which are easier to automate (that is, are more completely
                prescribed) than
                others: 
                <ol>
                  <li>If the notes go out of range for that voice (too far above or
                    below the staff), you may shift them up or down by octave as
                    needed.</li>
                  <li>The tone tables specify that you may add sharps or flats on
                    certain notes according to <em>musica ficta</em> rules.</li>
                  <li>You may also do more complicated things like swapping the
                    notes for adjacent voices, which require your own judgment.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      <section>
        <h3>Digital Implementation</h3>
        <p>In this software we implement all those parts of the ark which are
        completely specified as automatic algorithms. This includes how to
        pull pitches and rhythms from the ark and match them with words.</p>
        <p>Instead of the user’s choice of vperms and rperms we choose to tempt
        fate (from a seventeenth-century Catholic perspective and roll the dice,
        a literally aleatoric method, by using computer-generated pseudo-random
        numbers.  Other elements that depend on the user’s taste and judgment,
        or elements under-specified by Kircher (like text underlay in
        the melismatic Syntagma II) we leave up to our own users’ discretion.</p>
        <p>Kircher does not provide a complete set of instructions, though,
        for the essential task of fitting the notes within vocal ranges while
        avoiding unwieldy leaps; I have written my own algorithm (using binary
        decision trees and weighted <q>badness</q> scores) to do this.</p>
        <p>Kircher also does not provide a full specification for applying
        <em>musica ficta</em> accidentals based on his tone tables and other
        rules. Human performers who know the conventions of Kircher’s day
        could probably adjust the music in performance, but to make the music
        sound good automatically, as in the MIDI renditions on this website,
        requires more complicated adjustments. The current implementation is
        incomplete and does not cover all the difficult edge cases that
        arise.</p>
        <p>We encode the data of the ark itself (syntagmata, pinakes, etc.) in a
        set of tables in Haskell, technically nested vectors and lists.
        We read the input text and parameters from an XML file and parse the
        text into sections, sentences/stanzas, and phrases/lines.
        We generate a list of random numbers to use for each phrase, then we
        use these to select the correct vperms and rperms, and adjust these for
        tone and range according to the rules. We then convert our internal data
        types into MEI-XML output.</p>
        <p>In the web app, we use the third-party Verovio app to render the
        musical data to notation and MIDI format for automatic playback.</p>
      </section>
      </section>
      <section id="computer">
        <h2>Was the Arca musarithmica a computer?</h2>
        <p>
        Kircher’s device does not have an automatic mechanism, and requires a human operator.
        But the operator does not need to do anything except retrieve data from the tables in the Arca and transform it according to reasonably precise rules.
        Kircher intended his device for the total musical novice, a
        <q>Tyro</q> who knew <em>nothing</em> about music except the rules he
        provided. 
        So although the <em>device</em> is not automatic, the <em>system</em> is automatic in the sense that no additional knowledge or discretion is needed beyond what is built in to the device and the specified algorithm for operating it.
        </p>
        <p>
        In order for a digital computer to step in as the operator, only a few adjustments need to be made to fill gaps and inconsistencies in Kircher’s system.
        The rest of the work in writing the software just consisted of taking a
        system designed for a human operator who can manipulate graphic symbols
        on paper and translating it to the kinds of instructions needed by the digital automaton.
        The modern computer is the ultimate know-nothing, as it can only do exactly what it is programmed to do, and in the end its processing all boils down to manipulating binary numbers.
        The implementation in Haskell, a pure-functional programming language, demonstrates that the Arca can be modeled as a single mathematical function, transforming a set of inputs into a set of outputs.
        </p>
        <p>
        For a more in-depth study of the Arca and this implementation, see the
        article, <q><a href="computational_system/index.html">Athanasius
            Kircher’s Arca musarithmica (1650) as a Computational System</a></q>.

      <section id="reception">
        <h2>Who Used the Arca?</h2>
        <p>
        After describing the Arca, Kircher says he not only built one but that he and other musicians had been using it to generate complex music, and gives an example of a composition produced with the Arca.
        He also says there is a secret, customized version of the Arca with considerably greater capabilities, which he is reserving for the inspection of trusted associates.
        No other trace survives of this <q>Arca 2.0</q>, but there is evidence that other people used the Arca as specified in the <em>Musurgia universalis</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Three physical implementations of the ark are known to have survived in the UK and the rest of Europe—in Cambridge, Wolfenbüttel, and Florence.
        These look like elaborate recipe boxes filled with slats, each of which is covered with a copy of Kircher’s tables of <em>musarithmi</em> or <q>music-numbers</q>.
        No one has yet found a surviving piece of music generated with the ark.
        </p>
        <p>
        I found evidence for a previously unknown copy of the Arca in Puebla, Mexico,
        which is the first known implementation in the New World.
        Buried within an obscure manuscript miscellany filled with mathematical
        calculations, tax records, and experiments in universal chronology and
        trigonometry, there is a copy of a core selection of Kircher’s Arca tables.
        The parts copied out would be sufficient to operate the device, even if one did not actually build a box to put them in.
        The author was probably a university mathematics professor in Puebla, writing around 1690, and the array of interests in the manuscript collection show the kind of intellectual climate in which Kircher’s work was read.
        The poet and nun Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz described herself as <q>Kircherizing</q>, when she followed Kircher in following chains of connections between elements of creation in the pursuit of universal knowledge.
        She and the copyist of the Puebla Arca were part of a circle of such Kircher enthusiasts in seventeenth-century New Spain.
        I also found another source, a digest of the Arca system from late
        eighteenth-century Madrid, that demonstrates the longevity of these
        interests through the period of the Scientific Revolution and into the
        Enlightenment—though numerous mistakes also suggest that the author
        struggled to understand Kircher’s system and likely viewed it as merely
        a curiosity, rather than a link in a chain leading to divine truth.

          implemented a different music-computing device by Kircher, the
          <cite>Organum mathematicum</cite>.
          That device was much simpler musically but had the virtue of also
          being able to calculate the date of Easter and lots of other useful
          functions.
          That implementation in Perl allowed a user to set a very small set of
          short texts in simple or florid style.
          It could generate MIDI output, even using vocal synthesis to render
          the actual syllable sounds.
          Bumgardner highlights both Kircher’s clear intent to build an
          automatic, algorithmic system for composition, and the inconsistencies
          and underspecified elements that undermine that goal. He also
          recognizes Kircher’s ambivalence about the need for random choices in
          order to automate the system fully.

          Agnes Cäcilie Bohnert’s dissertation 
          (<a href="#Bohnert:Kircher">2010</a>) provides a comprehensive
          treatment of Book VIII of the <cite>Musurgia</cite> in detail,
          including its mathematical and philosophical foundations.
          Every musical combination in the ark is examined and compared.
          Bohnert implemented syntagma I and II of the ark in a Java program
          which according to her description 
          (<a href="#Bohnert:Kircher">Bohnert 2010, 123–126</a>), followed
          quite closely the manual method described by Kircher.
          Users would select <q>musarithms</q> by hand, one at a time,
          adjust them, and add them to the musical composition, and then hear
          the result.
          Though I was not able to examine the program, it is not described as
          fully automatic, and Bohnert says it can only create very short
          settings of a small number of texts.
