        <h1>How to compose music using the ark</h1>

        <ol>
          <li>Kircher expects you to <strong>prepare a text</strong> in Latin or
            another language, with words divided into syllables, marked long or
            short. You can set texts in several Classical meters (like
            Anacreontic or Sapphic), but you can also set irregular verse and
            prose texts.  <ul>
              <li>In this web app, we provide a set of <strong>pre-marked
                  texts</strong>.</li>
              <li>With the command-line version, you can create your own texts
                that might even have multiple sections in different styles and
                moods!</li>
            </ul>
          </li> 
          <li>Next, Kircher wants you to choose several aspects of the music
            setting you want the ark to create:
            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>style</strong> and texture of the music:
                <ol>
                  <li>you can opt for simple, note-against-note counterpoint (like a
                    hymn),</li>
                  <li>or florid, melismatic counterpoint (like a motet, anthem, or
                    even fugue).</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>The <strong>mood</strong> or character of the text and its
                setting, which determines the choice of one of twelve musical
                <q>tones</q> or <q>church keys</q> (<em>toni
                  ecclesiastici</em>). 
                The tones are not the same as modern keys, nor do they match
                up exactly with the medieval modes used to classify
                plainchant.
                They seem to be a hybrid of the polyphonic <q>tones</q> used
                by keyboardists to introduce and accompany the eight
                traditional chant psalm tones, with the twelve-mode system
                introduced by the earlier theorists Glarean and Zarlino.
                (see <a href="#Barnett:TonalOrganization17C">Barnett 2002</a>).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>The <strong>musical meter</strong> (technically, mensuration)
                of the setting. 
                <ol>
                  <li>In the simple style, you can choose 
                    <ol>
                      <li>duple meter (cut C),</li>
                      <li>triple minor (C3, three minims/half notes per metrical
                        unit),</li>
                      <li>or triple major (cut C3, three semibreves/whole notes
                        per metrical unit).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                    Some duple-meter permutations in the ark have a minim pulse
                    (C) and others have a semibreve pulse (cut C).
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>In florid style, everything is in duple meter (C).</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If you are operating the ark by hand, you use these input
            parameters to select the proper tables. 
            <ul> 
              <li><strong>Syntagma:</strong> There are three <em>syntagmata</em>
                or large divisions in the ark. For simple style, you select from
                Syntagma I; for florid, use Syntagma II.
                <p>
                Kircher provides a third syntagma as well, but because it would
                be much more difficult if not impossible to make completely
                automatic, we have omitted it from this implementation.
                (An exercise for the reader!)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Pinax:</strong> Each syntagma containes a set of
                <q>rods</q> or <em>pinakes</em> (singular, <em>pinax</em>). You
                select the <em>pinax</em> based on the meter of the text.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Column:</strong> Each pinax contain
                several columns of data. The column is either a free choice, or
                is based on the order of lines in the poem.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Voice and rhythm permutations:</strong> Each column
                includes two parts: sets of numbers representing musical pitches
                (we call these <q>voice permutations</q> or vperms), and sets of
                musical notes representing rhythmic durations (<q>rhythm
                  permutations</q> or rperms).
                <ul>
                  <li>In syntagma I (simple counterpoint), the user is supposed
                    to freely choose one set of vperms and one set of
                    rperms. All the musical voices use the same rhythms.
                    <ul>
                      <li>In syntagma I, there are (generally) three sets of
                        rhythm permutation, one for each type of musical meter
                        you can use.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>In syntagma II (florid counterpoint), there is a set of
                      rperms that matches up with each vperm, so that there is a
                      specified rhythm for each of the SATB voices. This makes
                      independent contrapuntal voices possible.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                  </li>
            </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Writing the  music down:</strong> Next you lay out what
                Kircher calls the <em>palimpsest phontacticum</em>, or what the rest
                of us call <q>music paper</q>.
                You draw out four staves and put an appropriate combination of clefs
                for the four voices. These determine the octave and range of the
                musical output for each voice. You also add a flat in the key
                signature if your tone is in <em>cantus mollis</em> according to the
                table, and add the appropriate mensuration sign.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Matching pitches, rhythms, and syllables:</strong> For
                each phrase of text, you take the pitch numbers and look them up in
                the table for the given tone in order to get note names. You pair
                these note names with the rhythmic values, or just put rests when
                those are given. You write these values on the staff,
                making certain adjustments as needed.
              </li>
              <li>Kircher describes a variety of <strong>adjustments</strong>, some
                of which are easier to automate (that is, are more completely
                prescribed) than
                others: 
                <ol>
                  <li>If the notes go out of range for that voice (too far above or
                    below the staff), you may shift them up or down by octave as
                    needed.</li>
                  <li>The tone tables specify that you may add sharps or flats on
                    certain notes according to <em>musica ficta</em> rules.</li>
                  <li>You may also do more complicated things like swapping the
                    notes for adjacent voices, which require your own judgment.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Digital Implementation</h1>
        <p>In this software we implement all those parts of the ark which are
        completely specified as automatic algorithms. This includes how to
        pull pitches and rhythms from the ark and match them with words.</p>
        <p>Instead of the user’s choice of vperms and rperms we choose to tempt
        fate (from a seventeenth-century Catholic perspective and roll the dice,
        a literally aleatoric method, by using computer-generated pseudo-random
        numbers.  Other elements that depend on the user’s taste and judgment,
        or elements under-specified by Kircher (like text underlay in
        the melismatic Syntagma II) we leave up to our own users’ discretion.</p>
        <p>Kircher does not provide a complete set of instructions, though,
        for the essential task of fitting the notes within vocal ranges while
        avoiding unwieldy leaps; I have written my own algorithm (using binary
        decision trees and weighted <q>badness</q> scores) to do this.</p>
        <p>Kircher also does not provide a full specification for applying
        <em>musica ficta</em> accidentals based on his tone tables and other
        rules. Human performers who know the conventions of Kircher’s day
        could probably adjust the music in performance, but to make the music
        sound good automatically, as in the MIDI renditions on this website,
        requires more complicated adjustments. The current implementation is
        incomplete and does not cover all the difficult edge cases that
        arise.</p>
        <p>We encode the data of the ark itself (syntagmata, pinakes, etc.) in a
        set of tables in Haskell, technically nested vectors and lists.
        We read the input text and parameters from an XML file and parse the
        text into sections, sentences/stanzas, and phrases/lines.
        We generate a list of random numbers to use for each phrase, then we
        use these to select the correct vperms and rperms, and adjust these for
        tone and range according to the rules. We then convert our internal data
        types into MEI-XML output.</p>
        <p>In the web app, we use the third-party Verovio app to render the
        musical data to notation and MIDI format for automatic playback.</p>

          Carlo Maria Chierotti’s dissertation and articles 
          (<a href="#Chierotti:KircherDiss">n.d.</a>, 
          <a href="#Chierotti:KircherMirifica">1992</a>, and 
          <a href="#Chierotti:KircherComporre">1994</a>) 
          on the same subject provide a good overview of Kircher’s work and the
          structure and operation of the ark, with some detailed analysis of the
          types of harmonies and cadences in the voice permutations.
          He does not view the <i>Arca musarithmica</i> as a machine or
          consider its potential as an automatic system, emphasizing instead how
          much interaction is actually demanded from the user in order to
          produce good results.</p>
          <p>
          Jim Bumgardner (<a href="#Bumgardner:Kircher">2009</a>) 
          implemented a different music-computing device by Kircher, the
          <cite>Organum mathematicum</cite>.
          That device was much simpler musically but had the virtue of also
          being able to calculate the date of Easter and lots of other useful
          functions.
          That implementation in Perl allowed a user to set a very small set of
          short texts in simple or florid style.
          It could generate MIDI output, even using vocal synthesis to render
          the actual syllable sounds.
          Bumgardner highlights both Kircher’s clear intent to build an
          automatic, algorithmic system for composition, and the inconsistencies
          and underspecified elements that undermine that goal. He also
          recognizes Kircher’s ambivalence about the need for random choices in
          order to automate the system fully.
          </p>
          <p>
          Agnes Cäcilie Bohnert’s dissertation 
          (<a href="#Bohnert:Kircher">2010</a>) provides a comprehensive
          treatment of Book VIII of the <cite>Musurgia</cite> in detail,
          including its mathematical and philosophical foundations.
          Every musical combination in the ark is examined and compared.
          Bohnert implemented syntagma I and II of the ark in a Java program
          which according to her description 
          (<a href="#Bohnert:Kircher">Bohnert 2010, 123–126</a>), followed
          quite closely the manual method described by Kircher.
          Users would select <q>musarithms</q> by hand, one at a time,
          adjust them, and add them to the musical composition, and then hear
          the result.
          Though I was not able to examine the program, it is not described as
          fully automatic, and Bohnert says it can only create very short
          settings of a small number of texts.
